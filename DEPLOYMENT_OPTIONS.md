# Alternative Deployment Options for MCP PowerPoint Server

Since you don't have direct Azure permissions, here are several alternative approaches to deploy your containerized MCP server:

## Option 1: Request Azure DevOps Setup from IT Admin

**What you need to ask your IT/Azure admin:**

1. **Create Azure DevOps Project**: Request access to Azure DevOops with permissions to create pipelines
2. **Service Connection**: Ask them to create a service connection to your Azure subscription
3. **Container Registry**: Request creation of Azure Container Registry (ACR)
4. **Container Apps Environment**: Request Azure Container Apps environment setup

**Files to share with admin:**
- `azure-pipelines.yml` - The build pipeline configuration
- `infra/` folder - Infrastructure as Code templates
- Resource requirements: Container Registry + Container Apps in East US region

## Option 2: Use GitHub Actions with Azure Service Principal

**What your admin needs to create:**
1. **Service Principal** with Container Apps permissions
2. **GitHub Secrets** with Azure credentials
3. **Azure Container Registry** 

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
```
AZURE_CREDENTIALS - Service principal JSON
REGISTRY_USERNAME - ACR username  
REGISTRY_PASSWORD - ACR password
```

## Option 3: Deploy to Alternative Platforms

### A. Railway.app (Easiest)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### B. Render.com
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Render
2. Choose "Web Service" 
3. Use Docker build
4. Set PORT environment variable to 3000

### C. Fly.io
```bash
# Install Fly CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Initialize and deploy
flyctl launch
flyctl deploy
```

### D. DigitalOcean App Platform
1. Connect GitHub repo
2. Choose "Docker" as source
3. Configure environment variables

## Option 4: Local Development Testing

For local testing without Docker Desktop:
```bash
# Use Node.js directly
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# Test the MCP server
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer abc" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Try Railway.app first** - It's the simplest cloud deployment
2. **Request Azure setup from IT** - For production enterprise deployment
3. **Use Render.com** - Good free tier alternative
4. **Test locally** - Verify everything works before cloud deployment

Each option will give you a live URL to use in your VS Code MCP configuration.
